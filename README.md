# 🧠 Inside AI’s Brain  
*A Theoretical and Practical Exploration of Neural Networks*

This repository is a **hybrid journey** through the inner workings of Artificial Neural Networks — blending **mathematical intuition**, **theoretical depth**, and **hands-on implementation**.

> Learn not only *how* neural networks work — but *why* they work.
