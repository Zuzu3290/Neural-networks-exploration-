# Inside AI's Brain -
This is more or less a theoretical study to have a strong interpretation about the core working brtain mechansim of AI. 
This repository will contain the study and code of implementing and utilizing a neural network architecture. 

# Repository Navigation 
The main branch cotains an explicit mathemtaical notatins and theoritical contemplation about neural network.
The "Scratch" branch coantins an explicit prgram written in python from srcatch. 



# Scratch 
This branch cotains a working python program from scratch designin with the foucs of developing a modifiable neurla network and reusable application module for variaes training and testing applications. 

# TensorFlow-NN and Pytorch-NN 
this branch contains a working neural network  program written using pytorch and tensorflow. This branch was built underthe objective of constructing deep neural networks for the basic neural network architecture. 

# CNN 

# RNN
