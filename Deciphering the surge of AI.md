## 📖 Introduction  

> *“Evolution and innovation are now presentable to the modern generation just through a click on the screens of their smart devices.”*  

The very notion of **technological advancement** has become so common that it is often used loosely — even as the scale of innovation continues to expand and refine almost every moment in different corners of the world.  
Keeping track of it all at the rate it’s growing isn’t feasible.

## 🏛️ From Philosophy to Science  

Once upon a time, a single visionary mind laid the foundations for modern science: **Aristotle**.  
His philosophies associated knowledge with nature, igniting science to emerge and flourish across civilizations.  

From this foundation, history produced intellectual giants:  

- **Galileo Galilei** – Father of Physics ⚛️  
- **Al-Khwarizmi** – Father of Algebra ➗  
- **Isaac Newton** – Father of Calculus 📐  

Their brilliance advanced humanity through eras of enlightenment:  
**Ancient Greek Golden Age → Islamic Golden Age → Enlightenment → Industrial Revolution.**
