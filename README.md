# Project name: Deciphering the surge of AI
Introduction: 
Evolution and innovation now presentable to the modern generation just through a click on the screens of their smart devices. The very notion of technological advancement has become so common that it is often used loosely, even as the scale of innovation continues to expand and refine almost every moment in different corners of the world.  It’s such so that keeping track of them all at the rate its growing isn’t feasible.

To believe that once upon a time, a single visionary mind laid the foundations for modern science: Aristotle. The man that drafted philosophies that sought to associate knowledge with nature. Providing the stage of igniting science emerge and flourish across the region through these philosophies. As a result, society was nurtured, and high intellectual were produced.  Among Galileo Galilei: the Father of Physics, Al-Khwarizmi: the Father of Algebra, and Isaac Newton: the Father of Calculus stand as examples of brilliance. A few brilliances who pulled the theories, advancing the field of science with rationality, experimental results, and theory, setting the stage for the great intellectual epochs of history: from Ancient Greek Golden Age to the Islamic Golden Age to the Enlightenment Era to the well-known Industrial Revolution. This was the peak, the pivotal point onwards where the rate of innovation accelerated unpredictably, consequently blooming the current norm of the Digital world. 

Within a century, another profound transition took place, within a blink of an eye humanity encountered the rift of AI revolution, the aggression, the ambition to replicate the cognitive attributes of the human brain. This is threshold we now endeavour on: the transcendence points zof AI revolution in 2023-2024. 

This research focuses on analysing this pivotal rift, examining the rudimentary foundations of AI that has surged. The engineering of intelligence that can generate constructive results across multiple disciplines all prompted by a single command.
